              Hi, I’m Peculia Peweel, a passionate software development student
              currently specializing in web development. I have a strong
              interest in creating efficient and user-centered solutions,
              particularly on the front end, where I enjoy seeing the visual
              impact of my code. I have experience working with technologies
              like React, Node.js, TailwindCSS and Material UI, and I’m
              currently expanding my knowledge in MongoDB and other back-end
              technologies like GraphQL and Next.js.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-300 mb-4 md:mb-6 md:text-lg md:max-w-[60ch]">
              While I’m still growing in my coding journey, I’m highly motivated
              to learn and improve. I approach challenges with a problem-solving
              mindset and perseverance, always eager to develop my skills
              further. I believe that with each project, I become more confident
              in my ability to deliver clean, functional, and scalable code.
            </p>
            <p className="text-zinc-300 mb-4 md:mb-6 md:text-lg md:max-w-[60ch]">
              I’m excited to explore opportunities that allow me to apply and
              deepen my expertise in both front-end and back-end development. I
              aim to bring creativity and technical knowledge to every project I
              work on, always with the goal of creating meaningful digital
              experiences.
